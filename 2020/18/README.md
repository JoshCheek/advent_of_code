This one, I did a lot of work to parse myself before I realized the easy hacky
solution that makes the problem extremely easy. I left the old effortful
implementations in the files with the `.old` extensions.

```sh
./first-entry < input
./second-entry < input
./first-entry.old < input
./second-entry.old < input
```
